bmp2png / png2bmp version 1.62 - Sep 04, 2005
---------------------------------------------

bmp2png/png2bmp is a pair of simple command-line utilities that convert
between Windows BMP format and PNG (Portable Network Graphics).

This software is freeware.


Using them
----------

The basic command line is:

   bmp2png [-options] list of bmp files ...
   png2bmp [-options] list of png files ...

The input files are not modified; the output data is written to files
which have the same names except for extension. bmp2png always uses
".png" for the output file name's extension; png2bmp uses ".bmp".

To list the options, simply type "bmp2png" or "png2bmp" with no
arguments.
