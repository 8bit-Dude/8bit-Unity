Welcome to pygubu a GUI designer for tkinter
============================================

Pygubu is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces
for the python tkinter module.

The user interfaces designed are saved as XML, and by using the pygubu builder
these can be loaded by applications dynamically as needed.
Pygubu is inspired by Glade.


Installation
------------

Pygubu requires python >= 2.7 (Tested only in python 2.7.3 and 3.2.3
with tk8.5)

Download and extract the tarball. Open a console in the extraction
path and execute:

::

    python setup.py install


Usage
-----

Create an UI definition using pygubu and save it to a file. Then, create
your aplication script as shown below:

::

    #test.py
    import tkinter as tk
    import pygubu

    class Application:
        def __init__(self, master):

            #1: Create a builder
            self.builder = builder = pugubu.Builder()

            #2: Load an ui file
            builder.add_from_file('test.ui')

            #3: Create the widget using a master as parent
            self.mainwindow = builder.get_object('mainwindow', master)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        root = tk.Tk()
        app = Application(root)
        root.mainloop()
