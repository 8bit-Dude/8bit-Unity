* About this file
=================

This file lists the most important user-visible changes for each official
release of VICE.  See `ChangeLog' in the root dir of the source tree for a
more detailed list of all the changes in the code.


* Upgrading
===========

If you run into trouble please try removing any VICE configuration files
left from previous installs.
(vice.ini / .vicerc / vice2.cfg / vice-sdl.ini depending on platform)

Before reporting bugs, always try with a clean config (run emulator with
-default or use "restore default config" in the UI).


* Changes in VICE 3.2
======================

** General
----------

- New (experimental) GTK3 native port, this and the SDL(2) port will replace
  all other ports (which will get removed) in VICE 3.3 and onward.

- Handling of the `-keybuf` command now works properly for all emulators and
  RAM sizes.

- Fixed handling of LOAD"$$" with virtual devices.

- Fixed @CD, @MD and @RD commands for virtual filesystem devices.

- Fixed NEOS Mouse emulation.

- Call the new CIA "8521" instead of "6526A" (which is wrong) in the UIs.

- Added 4sid support.

- Fixed tape wobble.

- Erase timing fixes in flash core.

- Don't allocate sectors on tracks > 70 in the BAM of 1571 images.

- Ethernet emulation: fix register mapping in rr-net mode.

- reSID: fixed envelope bugs shown by testprogs/SID/env_test/.

- Fixed 6509 CPU port issues.

- Added support for TAP virtual network interface.

- Fixed drive clock overflow. Drive and host went out of sync on clock overflow
  (every ~4G cycles), which would break loading or custom drive code in the case
  loader/stuff is not idle during overflow window. Also drive would execute
  ~4G cycles out of sync, which made the emulator freeze for a while.

** Monitor
----------

- Fix monitor 'm' command buffer overflow.

- Added conditional on values in memory to breakpoint handling.


** SDL changes
--------------

- Cosmetic overhaul of the SDL UI.

- New drag'n'drop support for the SDL2 port(s).

- Fixed monitor display of printables with the 'M' (memdump) command.

- Fixed drive status display in statusbar.

- Added "advance frame".

- Disable the mouse pointer unless we really need it.

- Change MacOSX SDL menu key to F10 to accommodate old MacBooks etc.

- Change default menu key for sdl amiga based platforms to 'F10'.

- Added default hotkey files (with hotkeys similar to existing GUIs).

- Added various keymaps for use with keyrah in combian/retropie.

- Added controller mapping file for PS3 controller.


** Android changes
------------------

- Do not enable mouse emulation by default.


** Mac OS X changes
-------------------

- Reinstated the Cocoa UI's Video Settings dialog. Some of the controls
  don't work properly, but it's better than nothing.

- Added a PET model selection menu to the Cocoa UI.

- Fixed Cocoa UI's CPU memory window display. It still requires the monitor
  to be activated before it will show anything, however.


** OS/2 changes
---------------

- Removed native OS/2 port. The native OS/2 port has been lagging behind
  severely, and the recently added SDL OS/2 port is up-to-date, making the
  unmaintained native OS/2 port obsolete.

** Windows changes
------------------

- The ethernet interface is now properly 'remembered'.

- Creating a new disk image now properly translates the disk label and ID into
  PETSCII.

======================

** General
----------

- Added x64sc, the accurate C64 emulator:

  * VIC-II emulation rewritten from scratch using results from extensive
    testing with newly written test programs on real hardware.

  * Emulation is done on a cycle by cycle basis combined with pixel exact
    dot clock domain handling.

  * Accurate handling of all possible in-line splits of VIC-II registers
    and graphics data.

  * C64 model and even individual chip revisions can be selected for very
    detailed emulation of their differences.

  * Equally accurate PAL, NTSC and PAL-N emulation.

  We believe x64sc is one of the most accurate C64 emulators at the
  moment.

* Changes in VICE 2.2
======================

** General
----------

- On autostart, do not change true drive emulation (TDE) anymore by
  default. The old behaviour can be switched on again by specifiying
  -autostart-handle-tde on the command line.
  There is one drawback of this behaviour: If TDE is switched on, an
  image attached must fit to the drive type set. For example, when you
  attach a .D81, you must have the drive type set to 1581, or the
  autostart will fail.

- Added automatic Warp mode during autostart. If this resource is enabled then
  VICE automatically enables the warp mode and then loads a file. After
  loading the warp mode is disabled again and then the program is started.

- Autostarting a PRG file can now be done in three different ways:

  * "Virtual FS": This mode mounts the directory where the file resides as a
    virtual filesystem on drive #8 and then loads the PRG via virtual drive
    traps. This was the only way of autostarting in previous VICE versions
    and is still the default.

  * "Inject to RAM": The PRG file is loaded from VICE directly into the RAM of
    the emulated machine. Then the memory setup of a Basic LOAD is simulated
    and the program is run. This is the fastest mode available but may lack
    compatibility as no actual load operation was performed in the emulator.
    However, no drive setup is altered during the operation.

  * "Diskimage": VICE creates a temporary new disk image and copies the
    contents of the PRG file onto it. Then this image is mounted in drive #8
    and the program is loaded from there. If TDE is enabled then the load
    operation is most compatible. The disk image stays attached until a new
    image is mounted.

- Improved PAL emulation is now available for Unix/Xaw XVideo mode, and
  AmigaOS. Only the YUV packed modes work, the planar modes still use the
  old code paths, though.

- Sound core has been reworked to enable lower latency of operation.
  Approximately 50 ms latency values are now routinely reached, and some
  people have reported that as low as 30 ms still works for them.

- New SDL port. See ReadmeSDL.txt for details.

- New win64 ports, both amd64/x64 and ia64 are supported (msvc compile only).

- New SDL based armle, mipsle, ppcbe and shle QNX 6.x ports.

- New SDL based M68k and sparc SunOS ports.

- New SDL based Syllable port.

- New SDL based Dingoo port.

- Remote monitor (in other words: TCP/IP interface to VICE monitor) added.

- Fixed non-6502/6510 CPU handling in monitor.

** C64/C128 changes
-------------------

- ReSID's resampler has been optimized with MMX assembly. Some long-standing
  bugs in resample-interpolate mode were also fixed.

- ReSID-FP has been optimized, too. It clocks the analog parts at half the
  rate now, which saves CPU during filter emulation especially for 6581 modes.

- Added SFX Sound Sampler and SFX Sound Expander emulation.

- Added EasyFlash cartridge emulation.

- Added paddle emulation.

- Added lightpen/lightgun emulation, currently only available for the following
  ports: SDL, GTK+, cocoa, win32/win64 and msdos.

- Added support for the following userport joystick adapters: CGA/Protovision,
  DXS/HIT, PET (normally only used on the PET/CBM2), Hummer (normally only
  used on the C64DTV) and OEM (normally only used on the VIC20).

** C128 changes
---------------

- Added RAM banks 2 and 3 support.

- Improved the VDC emulation.

- Stereo SID $D7xx range support.

** VIC20 changes
----------------

- New cycle exact emulation core.  Handles accesses to unconnected
  address space and in-line graphics data changes correctly.
  (fixes "Impossiblator 3" and others)

- Improved VIC emulation (in-line color/reverse mode changes on half-chars).

- Cartridge handling rewritten.

- Added Mega-Cart cartridge emulation.

- Added Final Expansion cartridge emulation.

- Default memory configuration changed from full to unexpanded.

- Added paddle emulation.

- Added lightpen/lightgun emulation, currently only available for the following
  ports: SDL, GTK+, cocoa, win32/win64 and msdos.

- Corrected the joystick support, since the VIC20 can only have one joystick
  attached on the joystick port.

- Added support for the following userport joystick adapters: CGA/Protovision
  (normally only used on the C64/C128), PET (normally only used on the
  PET/CBM2), Hummer (normally only used on the C64DTV) and OEM.

** PLUS4 changes
----------------

  (normally only used on the C64/C128), PET (normally only used for the PET),
  Hummer and OEM (normally only used on the VIC20).

** PET changes
--------------

- Corrected the joystick support, since the only way a PET can use a joystick
  is by a userport joystick adapter, the following userport joystick adapters
  are currently supported: CGA/Protovision (normally only used on the
  C64/C128), PET, Hummer (normally only used on the C64DTV) and OEM (normally
  only used on the VIC20).

** CBM2 changes
---------------

  is by a userport joystick adapter, the following userport joystick adapters
  are currently supported: CGA/Protovision (normally only used on the
  C64/C128), PET, Hummer (normally only used on the C64DTV) and OEM (normally
  only used on the VIC20).

** Unix changes
---------------

- Rudimentary PulseAudio sound driver has been added.

- Added support for dynamic loading of FFMPEG libraries.

- Added support for dynamic loading of OpenCBM and Lame library

** MS-Windows changes
---------------------

** Mac OS X changes
-------------------

- Cocoa port now supports all emulators

- Support for Mac OS X versions 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6 and PowerPC, Intel 32,
  and 64 Bit Support.

- Cocoa UI redesign. Emulator window is reduced to emulation display only.
  Emulator is controlled with the new control window. There disk and tape
  images can be attached by clicking on the image or dragging files there.
  Added the tape controls for the datasette and the status bar.
  Added a master volume slider.

- Added SyncDraw display mode that does temporal filtering of the frames
  generated by the machine (motion blur). This enhances the display quality in
  moving scenes if the machine frame rate does not match the display refresh
  rate (e.g. a 50 Hz C64 is shown on a 60 Hz LCD display)

- Added FLIcker Fixer to SyncDraw mode that does full frame reconstruction,
  i.e. two half frames are buffered and displayed as a full frame. This helps
  to reduce flicker in FLI modes but might introduce too much blur in other
  modes.

- Attach image file dialogs now show the contents of the selected disk/tape
  image and allow to pick a program to load from there.

- Emulator is now paused if Mac OS X goes to sleep.

  architectures, and compilers (gcc 4.0, gcc 4.2, clang)

- Libnet and libpcap updated to current versions

- Some keymap fixes in cocoa port


* Changes in VICE 2.1
======================

** General
----------

- The VICEplus project has been joined with VICE. Thus, x64dtv is now
  part of VICE.

- We can be contacted via IRC: #vice-dev on freenode

- Added a more accurate ReSID engine using floating point math (ReSID-FP).

- Added support for the USB HardSID.

- PAL emulation has been rewritten and optimized.

- Fixed the ACIA 6551 emulation. (x64/x128/xcbm2/xpet/xplus4)

- Monitor commands help text is now translated too
  (in ports where translation is available at all)

- Monitor IO command now displays IO area even if it is currently
  banked out.

- GCR file handling (.G64) issues an error message if the .G64 does not
  have the expected outline. Before, VICE just silently ignored such
  files.

- IRQ handling fix

** C64/C128 changes
-------------------

- Fixed the digimax sound generation.

- Added the RR clockport disable functionality at $DF00.0. Allows
  to disable the RRnet.

- Improved REU compatibility and timing.

** C64 changes
--------------

- Added isepic cartridge emulation.

- Added Double Quick Brown Box cartridge emulation.

** VIC20 changes
----------------

- Improved the sound emulation.

- Fixed the lowest note bug.

- Improved VIC emulation (exact in-line color/reverse mode changes).

** C64DTV changes
-----------------

- New emulator.

** Unix changes
---------------

- XRandR fullscreen implemented

- Command line option `-fullscreen' is supposed to do something
  useful. 

- Vsync code imported from win32 (based on openGL extension).
  see also doc/openGLsync-howto.txt.

- Vidmode (fullscreen support) is broken and therefore marked as
  deprecated. It will be removed in the next release if no-one takes
  responsibility to fix the broken code and is willing to maintain the
  code. 

- PAL Emulation (new implementation, improved speed) should be usable
  again (it was broken on certain display depths).

- Log messages are always english.

- Only x11 keymaps will be installed when doing a 'make install'.

- MIDI cartridge emulation for x128, x64 and xvic.

** MS-Windows changes
---------------------

- Watcom generated executables are more optimized.

- MIDI cartridge emulation for x128, x64 and xvic.

- When specifying the target for the RS232 communication
  (Menu Settings/RS232 Settings), the target can be specified by
  name now. Before, you had to use the IP address.

- Fixed some minor errors with the RS232 communication via TCP
  connections.

- RS232 can use real devices now, too.
  To use this feature, you have to specify the COM port used in
  Settings/RS232 Settings like:
  \\.\com1: baud=57600 parity=N data=8 stop=1

  The characters after the colon can be used to specify additional
  settings for the COM port. The string must have the same form as the
  mode command's command-line arguments:
  [baud=b][parity=p][data=d][stop=s][to={on|off}][xon={on|off}] 
  [odsr={on|off}][octs={on|off}][dtr={on|off|hs}][rts={on|off|hs|tg}]
  [idsr={on|off}]

  The above example specifies COM1 with a baud rate of 57600, no parity,
  8 data bits and 1 stop bit.

  Note that the leading \\.\ is used to distinguish between TCP/IP
  targets and real devices, thus, you have to use it.

  (Sorry, no fancy UI yet.)

- vsid GUI reworked: 
  * infoline appears only by pressing "I"
  * raises process priority. Otherwise, when in background,

  allows access to the CPU in the 1541 drive, and features watchpoints
  and breakpoints.

** Unix changes
---------------

- Sound and joystick is now supported on NetBSD too (courtesy of
  Krister Walfridsson <cato@df.lth.se>).

- Support for multiple keyboard layouts and joystick mappings has been
  added.  A "positional" layout for US keyboards is provided.  On the
  C64, VIC20 and C128 emulators, Ctrl is now mapped to Tab; the CBM
  key is now mapped to left Ctrl.

- The emulators and c1541 now use the real, full-featured GNU readline
  library if found.  Use `./configure --without-readline' for the old
  behavior.

- RS232 and printer support has been added.

- The XDebugger has died (R.I.P.).

** MS-DOS changes
-----------------

- Support for two "hardware" joysticks has been added.

- The emulated drive LED has been moved to the CapsLock LED; the
  ScrollLock LED is turned on when "warp" (maximum speed) mode is
  enabled.

- The menu system has been made a bit more usable.  It is now possible
  to open a submenu directly from the emulator screen by pressing Alt
  and the corresponding hotkey.

- An Allegro-based sound driver has been implemented.  It replaces the
  old MIDAS driver in binary distributions because of licensing
  incompatibilities.

- The video driver can now use triple buffering for much smoother
  animations (don't use it under Windows).

- 1351 mouse emulation has been implemented.  Make sure a working
  mouse driver is installed.

- It is now possible to use up to two "real" joysticks and to
  configure the keyboard settings for both emulated joysticks.  As a
  result, it is now possible for two people to play together with two
  "real" joysticks or just with the keyboard.

- A bug that could corrupt the file descriptor table has been fixed.

- The file selector is now much faster when running under plain
  MS-DOS, as it uses `findfirst()'/`findnext()' instead of DJGPP's
  Unix-like `opendir()'/`stat()' calls.

** Miscellaneous changes
------------------------

- The file system can be accessed from any drive now, and complete
  support for P00 files has been implemented.

- A major cleanup of the code has been done (this is what took most of
  the time between 0.14.2 and 0.15.0).  Porting and adding features or
  emulators is now much easier.

- "On the fly" Lynx and Zipcode support has been added (use with care,
  though).

- A couple of bugs in the fast serial emulation have been fixed
  (courtesy of Peter Andrew Felvegi <petschy@derceto.sch.bme.hu>).

- Sound output can now be oversampled up to 8 times.

- The `Directory' resource is now a list of paths.  The separator is
  `;' on MS-DOS and `:' on Unix.

- Serial traps can be enabled/disabled at runtime.

- Palette files have been introduced.

- Support for Dag Lem's new reSID SID emulation engine has been added.

- Automake is now being used.

- Color palettes are now completely configurable via system files.


* Changes in VICE 0.14.2
========================

** C64 changes
--------------

- A few VIC-II and CIA timing bugs have been fixed.

- The "sprite crunch" effect should now be emulated properly.

- Changes to $3FFF/$39FF in the video bank in the middle of one raster
  line do not affect the whole line anymore.

- Color of forced $FF DMA characters is now correct.

- The SpeedDOS parallel cable is now emulated.

- More accurate SID filter parameters when the sampling frequency is
  different from 44.1 KHz.

- The `TapeName' resource has been removed.

** VIC20 changes
----------------

- An annoying bug that prevented BASIC from working has been fixed;

- True 1541 emulation works again.

- The `TapeName' resource has been removed.

** PET changes
--------------

- Emulation of joysticks connected to the user port has been added.

** Unix changes
---------------

- The "change working directory" command displays the current working
  directory as default.

- A new status bar on the bottom of the emulation window displays the
  current speed and frame rate, and the status (i.e. LED + R/W head
  position) of the disk drive when the true 1541 emulation is turned
  on.

** MS-DOS changes
-----------------

- A bug that caused sprites to appear near the screen when the
  640x480 resolution was used has been fixed.

** Miscellaneous changes
------------------------

- A little timing error in the 6510 RMW instructions using absolute
  indexed addressing has been corrected.

- Much improved 1541 emulation: most custom write routines should now
  work.


* Changes in VICE 0.14.1
========================

** C64 changes
--------------

- A nasty CIA-related bug has been fixed.


* Changes in VICE 0.14.0
========================

** 6502/6510 changes
--------------------

- Several mostly timing-related 6510 bugs have been fixed (thanks to
  Andreas Boose's test suites).

** C64 changes
--------------

- Better SID (audio chip) emulation.  Now filters are emulated and
  waveforms are more accurate.  (Many thanks go to Michael Schwendt,
  author of SIDplay, for helping out with this and for providing the
  filter code and the SID wave tables.)

- Some CIA bugs have been fixed (big thanks to Andreas Boose for
  reporting them).

- The IEC bus recalculation has been made slightly faster (but you
  will probably not notice this, also because the true 1541
  compatibility improvements have made the emulation a bit slower).

- Some VIC-II bugs have been fixed (more big thanks to Andreas for his
  invaluable test suite).

- Disk/tape images can be "autostarted" from the command-line (with
  the new `-autostart' option) or at runtime (i.e. you can attach the
  image and let the emulator run and execute the first program on it
  for you).  This also works with `P00' and raw CBM binary files.

** VIC20 changes
----------------

- Fixed a small resizing-related bug.

** PET changes
--------------

- Improved/fixed keyboards on X11.

- New `PetModel', `VideoWidth' and `KeyboardType' resources.

- Added support for 2001, 4032B and 8096 PETs.

- Better CRTC emulation: R01 (line width) and R12 (control register)
  are honoured now.

** Unix changes
---------------

- Dispatching of Xt events fixed (there was a very stupid bug that
  caused event loops to do busy waits--argh!).

- Made WindowMaker-compliant (x64, xvic and xpet can now be docked).
  Now, could anybody please contribute cool NeXTish truecolor icons?
  :-)

- Better handling of window resizing.

- `configure' now uses Xaw3d only if `--with-xaw3d' is specified on
  the command line.

- The pop-up menus now work also if NumLock or CapsLock are activated.

- A private colormap is automatically used (even if `-install' has not
  been specified on the command line) if the emulator cannot allocate
  all the colors at startup.

- Increased portability: now compiles successfully on SunOS 4.x.

- Improved automatic frame skipping algorithm; it now gives a higher
  average frame rate.

- Different, possibly more usable, menu layout.

** MS-DOS changes
-----------------

- The contents of disk and tape images can be inspected before
  attaching them.

** Miscellaneous changes
------------------------

- The 1541 emulation is now more accurate (disk rotation is taken into
  account, but hardware formatting still does not work although we are
  not far from it).

- Safer handling for 1541 ROMs: a checksum is calculated, and turning
  full 1541 emulation on when no ROM is available does not make the
  emulator crash anymore.

- BZIP v2 support has been added (from Andreas Boose).

- Read-only support for various archiving formats (`.tar.gz', `.zip',
  `.lzh', `.zoo') has been added.

- The character ROMs are no longer built-in.

- Removed `.doc' extension from certain files in the documentation, as
  it confused HTML browsers.

- Useless Makefile target that caused problems with newer versions of
  GNU make removed.

- C1541 can now create disk images from Zipcoded files (`zcreate'),
  import Lynx archives (`unlynx') and execute DOS or UNIX commands
  (`system').  (`unlynx' and `system' have been contributed by Ricardo
  Ferreira.)

- Wrapping around $FFFF in monitor commands works now (beware: not for
  all of them, yet!).

- New, more usable, version of the `recomment' utility.

- Support for Simple DirectMedia Layer has been added.

- Character generator ROMs are not built-in anymore.


* Changes in VICE 0.13.0
========================

- Improved (now cycle-exact!) VIC-II emulation (big thanks go to
  Andreas Boose for helping me to improve it).

- More accurate 6510 emulation (emulates extra unused read accesses).

- Lower memory requirements.

- Complete MS-DOS port.

- Several CIA fixes.

- The VIC-I chip now emulates the reverse mode.

- Loading from tape handles the memory pointers correctly.

- Joystick emulation in the VIC20 emulator.

- Slightly better source code organization.


* Changes in VICE-0.12.1
========================

- The CIAs have been rewritten and are now more compatible and much
  faster (most of the games that ran much more slowly than usual with
  0.12.0 should now run at normal speed).

- VIC-II screen updates are now a little faster and also eat less
  memory.

- Disk images can now be attached in read-only mode.

- Gzip-compressed disk and tape images can be attached directly,
  without uncompressing them.

- The hardware-level 1541 emulation now supports writing to the disk
  through the VIAs, so that write patches to the drive ROM are not
  needed any longer. [please notice that this might not work with
  everything, as the emulation is not 100% exact]

- VICE can now be compiled also with the standard (0.8.0) joystick
  module (without digital joystick support, obviously).

- A little bug related to the right Shift key has been solved
  (courtesy of Bernhard Schwall).

- The numeric keypad can now be used to emulate diagonal directions
  too.

- The Linux audio driver also works on 8-bit sound cards.

- When a CPU jam happens (illegal opcode), the user can now choose
  between entering the monitor, enabling the XDebugger or resetting the
  machine.

- Implemented the new `skip' button in the XDebugger.

- Some little annoying bugs in the SID emulation have been fixed and
  combined pulse/sawtooth and pulse/triangle waveforms have been
  implemented.

- The automatic refresh rate setting works better when sound is
  enabled.

- The adaptive playback speed in the sound driver can now be disabled.

- Sound can now be turned off automatically when buffer overruns
  happen, and is automatically turned on again after a specified
  interval.

- AIX audio support has been implemented (courtesy of Chris Sharp
  (sharpc@hursley.ibm.com)).

- The sprite collision interrupts are more correctly triggered.

- A bad bug related to the sprite expansion register has been fixed.

- The video cache now handles sprite-background collisions correctly.

- A nasty bug that could cause VICE to hang has been fixed.

- Attaching floppy images to drive 9 or 10 no longer makes them appear
  in drive 8 when full 1541 emulation is enabled.

- Solved some problems with systems that do not have regexp.h (at
  least we hope so).

- GNU make is no longer needed to compile the PET and VIC20 emulators.

- The documentation has been updated.

- The `tounix' and `toiso' utilities have been added.

- The problem that made VICE die with an `alarm clock' signal on very
  slow or overloaded machines should now be gone.

- The file selector no longer dies if you type `~' with no `/' in the
  directory field.

- The file selector now has a "contents" button with which you can see
  the contents of a disk or tape image before attaching it.

- The X11 video driver automatically disables usage of the MITSHM
  extensions if they are not supported by the X11 server (even if the
  `mitshm' resource is non-zero).

- Some annoying REU-related bugs have been fixed.

- The MS-DOS version uses the Scroll Lock LED to emulate the drive LED.


* Changes in VICE-0.12.0
========================

Well, almost 90% of the emulation code has been rewritten (that's why
it took so long to have this release out), so it would be quite long
to list everything here.  Anyway, here are the most important new
features:

- New 6510 emulation, which is much faster and has (hopefully) correct
  memory fetch timings and exact emulation for all the opcodes.

- Completely rewritten video emulations, now much faster and more
  versatile: the window size can be doubled at run-time and the video
  cache can be disabled when not necessary.

- (Much) better VIC-II (C64 video chip) emulation, mostly rewritten
  from scratch: it can now handle most $D011 tricks such as VSP
  (Creatures and Mayhem in Monsterland work) and FLI; [yes, the silly
  sprite priority problems are gone]

- (Slightly) better VIC-I (VIC20 video chip) emulation (still
  incomplete).

- New SID emulator by Teemu Rantanen, with support for Linux, FreeBSD,
  Solaris and HP-UX (not all of these are stable, though).

- New CIA emulation with correct timing.

- Faster interrupt handling.

- Xaw-based GUI with popup menus and interactive file selector from
  the Free Widget Foundation.

- Hardware-based 1541 disk-drive emulation, that works with many
  custom loading routines.

- New resource handling that allows saving and loading of settings.

- MS-DOS port (no sound yet, UI almost non-existent).

- Better T64 handling (still buggy).

- Removed C128 emulator and RAM tester (sorry, we had no time to work
  at them).

- Much better Linux joystick support, that works with digital and
  analog joysticks with auto-calibration (courtesy of Bernhard Kuhn
  <kuhn@eikon.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de>); [it should compile out of the
  box now]

- Support for all possible VIC20 memory configurations on the command
  line (courtesy of Alexander Lehmann <alex@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>).

- Added `extract' command to c1541 (courtesy of Gerhard Wesp
  <gwesp@cosy.sbg.ac.at>).

- Added configure script for easier configuration and installation.

- Overall better source code organization, that should make porting
  much easier; [volunteers, you are welcome!]

- Better keyboard handling (reverse polling is correct now).

- The REU works.

- Several other bugs fixes and improvements we have lost track of.


* Changes in VICE-0.11.0
========================

- The CPU in x64, xvic and xpet is now 2 times faster on average; :->

- The VIC-II steals the correct number of cycles for bad lines and
  sprites, and correctly fetches the video RAM, so that FLD and other
  effects involving bad lines are now emulated correctly.

- The interrupt handling and the CIA/VIA emulations have been almost
  completely rewritten, thus dramatically increasing compatibility and
  reliability.

- The VIC-II sprite-sprite and sprite-background collision register
  emulation is (much) faster.

- The Read-Modify-Write bug of the CPU is correctly emulated when
  accessing the VIC-II register $D011.

- D64 and T64 can be directly attached (T64 in x64 and x128 only).

- A bad bug in the handling of the I/O registers of the 6510 has been
  fixed.

- The ADC and SBC decimal mode has been fixed.

- Various bugs in the 1541 error channel emulation have been fixed.

- The 1541 emulator and the standalone c1541 program support the Rx:
  (Rename) command and the Sx: (Scratch, delete) command now handles
  wildcards correctly.

- The infamous keyboard problem which caused key events to be lost
  when refresh was > 1 has been fixed.

- A IEEE-488 interface emulator has been introduced (emulates the
  original one) in x64, x128 and xvic.

- The xdebugger functionality has been improved (this part is still in
  the experimental stage, though).

- The `-8' and `-9' options allow to attach diskimages as drive #9 too.

- The Unix FS driver (Unit 11) has been improved, so that it supports
  the command/error channel and wildcards properly; moreover, new
  FS-specific commands (mkdir, rmdir, chdir) and errors (`permission
  denied' and `directory not empty') have been added.

- The VDC emulation in x128 supports variable character and screen
  size and bitmap mode as well (monochrome only and still under
  development).

- Some minor bugs in the VDC emulator have been fixed.

- The MMU implementation in x128 is much more complete, with true (not
  hard-coded) shared RAM and memory configuration support.

- A nasty bug which caused x128 to crash when changing speed and
  enabling/disabling the video emulators at runtime has been fixed.

- The Linux joystick has been fixed (it did not work at all in 0.10.0).

- The monitor `set' command no longer accepts ambiguous variable names.

- A new `hjoyport' variable/resource allows the user to choose the port
  for the hardware joystick (Linux only).

- Sun64 is no longer supported (if you need it, download x64-0.3.1).

- One thousand other little bugs have been fixed.
